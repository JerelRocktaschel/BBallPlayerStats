# BBallPlayerStats

This GitHub page will serve as both the product page for the BBall Players Stats App as well as provide technical information about how the app was built.

## Product Information

iPhone app that retrieves all current players from the NBA, sorts players alphabetically by last name and by team and displays a player detail view.

Each player stats detail view presents a pic of the player, jersey and position, demographics and season statistics. Select the favorite button to tag your favorite players and selecting the star button on the players list will show only your favorite players.

## Privacy Policy

The BBall Players Stats App collects no personal information at all. Zip. Nada.
